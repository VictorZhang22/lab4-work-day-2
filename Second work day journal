Second entry (3/1/2021 4:10pm – 5:20pm (75 minutes)):
Today I finally figured out the largest prime number problem that I was stuck on since last time. So, I started the day by practicing some find prime factor problems. After I know how to find the prime numbers, I set about drawing a diagram of the process.
 
Basically, my solution is to first see if the number is divisible by 2, which is the smallest prime number. Ill stop when the number finishes the first cycle, which should produce a prime factor of the number. Then the second cycle will be done on the other factor of the original number. The program will do this time after time until there`s nothing left to analyze. I also wrote a helper function that tests to see if a number is prime or not. I call this function after the main body program has found a factor of the original number. Then I pass this new number as the argument of my helper function and determine whether it is prime or not. 

The main roadblock of today’s work was to figure out how I can turn my diagram into code. I ended up using several changeable numbers so I can reset every time I split the original number by two. Another one was to find a way to compare the prime factors. I did this after I ran my program and found that I could find all of the prime factors of a number. When I saw that Python returned 3 numbers, I immediately thought of a list so I can compare each element easily. I didn’t write a helper function for this as I think it is pretty easy to comprehend. 

In conclusion, I think today went relatively well. I did not get frustrated like I did with other projects and my train of thought remained very clear. It was very nice to take on a relatively challenging problem right after a 2-week break in which I did not do anything related to Python. I feel like that I did not forget anything and that I am ready to learn more and solve more problems.
